In a determination of benzo[a]pyrene in a particular soil the following values were obtained
(mg/kg dry matter):
i 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
xi 9.89 10.06 9.88 10.09 10.15 10.34 9.96 10.1 9.97 10.27 9.78 10.19 10.02
a) Draw a histogram and describe your observations.
b) Draw a box plot and describe your observations.
c) Which distribution might the data follow? Check your assumption via a corresponding QQ
plot.
d) The limit value for benzo[a]pyrene in Germany is 10 mg/kg.
i. Test at the level α = 0.05 whether the average content of benzo[a]pyrene in the soil
at hand exceeds this limit value. To this end, also check the necessary assumptions for
testing this hypothesis by applying appropriate other tests.
ii. Additionally, we want to test at the level α = 0.05 whether the official limit is exceeded
in significantly more than 50% of all n = 13 cases! To this end, we transform the data
to Bernoulli data by checking whether xi
is above or below the limit and then apply a
binomial test for the success probability p. The null hypotehsis is, thus, p = 1/2. Read
about the binomial test and apply it in R to the data. What is your answer to the
above test question?
