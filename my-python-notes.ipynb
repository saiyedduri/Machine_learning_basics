Two very important ones are:\n\n## 1)K.I.S Keep its simple\n\n-  Subprogram behavior and length:  Subprograms should do precisely ONE conceptual task and no more. The length of a subprogram should allow it to be easily visually inspected; generally no more that one page in length.  Similarly you should generally not mix input/output and algorithmic logic in the same subprogram; it is alway a goal to separate I/O from logic.\n\n-  If a problem is can be decomposed into two or more independently solvable problems, then solve them independently and after you have implemented and tested the independent solutions, then combine them into the larger result.  This is sometimes known as \"Gall's Law\":\n\n- \"A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system.\"*\n\n### 2). \"Rule of Three\" (code duplication)\n\n- is a code refactoring rule of thumb to decide when a replicated piece of code should be replaced by a new procedure. \n    \"DONT REPEAT THE CODE. IT WOULD LOOK LIKE BRUTE FORCED PROGRAM\"  \n- It states that you are allowed to copy and paste the code once, but that when the same code is replicated three times, \n- It should be extracted into a new procedure. The rule was introduced by Martin Fowler in his text \"Refactoring\" and attributed to Don Roberts.\n\n- Duplication in programming is almost always in indication of poorly designed code or poor coding habits  because it makes code harder to maintain. \n- When the rule encoded in a replicated piece of code changes, whoever maintains the code will have to change it in all places correctly. \n- This process is error-prone and often leads to problems. If the code exists in only one place, then it can be easily changed there. \n- This rule is can even be applied to small number of lines of code, or even single lines of code.\n- For example, if you want to call a function, and then call it again when it fails, it's OK to have two call sites; however, if you want to try it five times before giving up, there should only be one call site inside a loop rather than 5 independent calls.\n\n## 3) Ninety-ninety rule ( failure to anticipate the hard parts)\n\n- The ninety-ninety rule is a humorous aphorism that states:The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time.The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time.\"—Tom Cargill, Bell Labs\n\n- That the total development time sums to 180% is a wry allusion to the notorious tendency of software development projects to significantly overrun their original schedules. It expresses both the rough allocation\n\n## 4)Efficiency vs. code clarity (chasing false efficiency):\n- Biggest mistakes that new programmers make is tweaking code to remove a couple of textual lines of high level code and replace it with a much more complex single line of code.\n- No perceivable impact on the runtime of most programs as most of them will likely be in the 90% of code that has little impact on the run-time of the program. \n- The real efficiency gains come from changing the order of complexity of the algorithm, such as changing from O(N^2) to O(NlogN) complexity.  \n- Occasionally, after the program is written and tested, it might prove to be slower than the problem specification calls for.  \n- On the these few occasions, and only after you have first optimized the complexity of the algorithm, then instrument or profile the code and find the 10% or less of the code that PROV\n\n## 5) Naming of things (subprograms and variables):  \n- to reduce the effort needed to read and understand source code which supports its maintainability\n- to enhance source code appearance (for example, by disallowing overly long names or unclear abbreviations)\n\n- Commonly, subprograms should have verb/verb phrase names as a subprogram should specify one specific task (see KISS rule) which should be an activity description.\n- Variables should have noun or adjective names as variables represent things or attributes of something.  \n\n## 6) Comments:\n- Write comments to describe how,why but never about what does the function does.But,we can put the what the program does only at the start of the program.  \n- readability of code: increase the readbility of code by introdicting sensible variables in the conditional expression than numbers in the middle of code. values can be initiated to variables as parameters \n\nReference: https://wou.edu/las/cs/csclasses/cs161/Lectures/rulesofthumb.html\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Writing print statement in python\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\n# Print statement syntax:\n# print (*objects, sep=’ ‘, end=’\\n’, file=sys.stdout)\n#python interprters converts the code into binary for compilers. \n#Comments:\n# Write comments to describe how,why but never about what does the funvtion does.But,we can put the what the program does only at the \n#start of the program.\n\n# For writing the print statement both '' and \"\" can be used.\nprint(\"Hello Sai Pavan Kumar\");\nprint(\"----o\");\n\n# 10 times the  *(star) sign.

An object’s identity never changes once it has been created; you may think of it as the object’s address in memory. The ‘is’ operator compares the identity of two objects; the id() function returns an integer representing its identity.\n\n\n- An object’s type determines the operations that the object supports (e.g., “does it have a length?”) and also defines the possible values for objects of that type. The type() function returns an object’s type (which is an object itself). \n\n-Objects can be mutable or immutable. Objects whose value can change are mutable, while objects whose value is unchangeable once created are called immutable.\n\n\nlist=[5,6]\ntuple=([list])\nlist[0]=3\nprint(tuple);\noutput:[[3, 6]]\n\n\n\n# Datatypes:\n\n1. **None:**\n   - This type has a single value. There is a single object with this value.\n   - This object is accessed through the built-in name None.\n   - It is used to signify the absence of a value in many situations, e.g., it is returned from functions that don’t explicitly return anything.\n   - Its truth value is false.\n\n2. **Numbers:**\n   - There are two types of integers:\n     1. **Integers (int):**\n        - Booleans (bool): These represent the truth values False and True.\n        - The two objects representing the values False and True are the only Boolean objects. The Boolean type is a subtype of the integer type, and Boolean values behave like the values 0 and 1, respectively, in almost all contexts, the exception being that when converted to a string, the strings \"False\" or \"True\" are returned, respectively.\n     2. **Python supports double precision:**\n        - Double precision: log10(253), which is about 15~16 decimal digits.         \n           i)  **Floating Point Numbers**      \n           ii) **Complex Numbers:**\n               ```python\n               a = complex(3, 4)\n               print(a)\n               a = 3 + 4j\n               print(a)\n               a = complex(input(\"Please Enter a Complex number in the form of a+bj\"))\n               print(a)\n               print(a.real, a.imag)\n               ```\n\n4. **Strings:**\n   - A string is a sequence of values that represent Unicode code points.\n   - Python doesn’t have a char type; instead, every code point in the string is represented as a string object with length 1.\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     string1 = \"Python works!\"\n     ```\n\n5. **Tuples:**\n   - The items of a tuple are arbitrary Python objects. Tuple values cannot be amended.\n   - Tuples of two or more items are formed by comma-separated lists of expressions.\n   - A tuple of one item (a ‘singleton’) can be formed by affixing a comma to an expression (an expression by itself does not create a tuple, since parentheses must be usable for grouping of expressions).\n   - An empty tuple can be formed by an empty pair of parentheses.\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)\n     ```\n\n6. **Bytes:**\n   - A bytes object is an immutable array. The items are 8-bit bytes, represented by integers in the range 0 <= x < 256.\n   - Bytes literals (like b'abc') and the built-in bytes() constructor can be used to create bytes objects.\n   - Also, bytes objects can be decoded to strings via the decode() method.\n\n7. **Mutable Sequences:**\n   - There are currently two intrinsic mutable sequence types:\n     1. **Lists:**\n        - The items of a list are arbitrary Python objects. It can consist of multiple datatypes.\n        - Lists are formed by placing a comma-separated list of expressions in square brackets.\n        - Note that there are no special cases needed to form lists of length 0 or 1.\n        - Example:\n          ```python\n          list1 = [1, 2.5, 3, \"python\"]\n          ```\n\n9. **Byte Arrays:**\n   - A bytearray object is a mutable array.\n   - They are created by the built-in bytearray() constructor.\n   - Aside from being mutable (and hence unhashable), byte arrays otherwise provide the same interface and functionality as immutable bytes objects.\n\n10. **Sets:**\n    - Sets are unordered sets of unique mutable objects. These represent a mutable set.\n    - They are created by the built-in set() constructor and can be modified afterward by several methods, such as add().\n    - Since set is unordered, we can't do indexing in sets.\n    - Example:\n      ```python\n      numbers = {1, 1, 2, 3, 4}\n      first = set(numbers)\n      second = {1, 6, 7}\n      first.add(1)\n      first.remove(4)\n      union_of_sets = first | second\n      intersection_of_sets = first & second\n      just_unique_first_numbers = first - second\n      unique_numbers = first ^ second\n      Is_first_subset_of_second = first < second\n      ```\n\n11. **Frozen Set:**\n    - A frozenset is an immutable set (like a tuple for a list).\n    - Example:\n      ```python\n      frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4})\n      ```\n\n\n    \n    \n# Immutable and mutable datatypes  \n - An object’s mutability is determined by its type; for instance, numbers, strings and tuples are immutable, \n while dictionaries and lists are mutable.\n\n- Implementation of garbage collectors: CPython currently uses a reference-counting scheme with (optional) delayed detection of cyclically linked garbage, which collects most objects as soon as they become unreachable, but is not guaranteed to collect garbage containing circular references\n\n- Some objects contain references to other objects; these are called containers. Examples of containers are tuples, lists and dictionaries.\n\n- In most cases, when we talk about the value of a container,\n  we imply the values, not the identities of the contained objects; however, when we talk about the mutability of a container, only the identities of the immediately contained objects are implied.So, if an immutable container (like a tuple) contains a reference to a mutable object, its value changes if that mutable object is changed.\n\n| Datatype         | Mutability     |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| NUMERIC TYPES    |                |\n|   - int          | Immutable      |\n|   - float        | Immutable      |\n|   - complex      | Immutable      |\n| TTEXT TYPES        |                |\n|   - str          | Immutable      |\n| SEQUENCE TYPES  |                |\n|   - list         | Mutable        |\n|   - tuple        | Immutable      |\n|   - range        | Immutable      |\n| MAPPING TYPES   |                |\n|   - dict         | Mutable        |\n| SET TYPES      |                |\n|   - set          | Mutable        |\n|   - frozenset    | Immutable      |\n| BOOLEAN TYPES    |                |\n|   - bool         | Immutable      |\n| BINAY TYPES     |                |\n|   - bytes        | Immutable      |\n|   - bytearray    | Mutable        |\n|   - memoryview   |                |\n| NONE TYPE       |                |\n|   - NoneType     | Immutable      |\n\n\nReference:  https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\n#Immutable Datatype:\n# str,range,tuple\n\n#complex datatye syntax:\na=complex(3,4);\nprint(a);\na=3+4j;\nprint(a);\na=complex(input(\"Please Enter a Complex number in the form of a+bj\"))\nprint(a);\n","metadata":{"id":"QWHyCOU9WlFo"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data converters\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#dataconverters:\n#int\n#float\n#bool\n#str","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#To know the variable_datatype= type(variable)\n\nprice=10;\np2=20;\n\nprint(\"Entered price is\",price);\n#(or);\nprint(\"Entered price is\"+ str(price));\n#(or)\nprint(f\"Entered price is {price},{p2}\");\n","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Identifiers","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"raw","source":"# The following identifiers are used as reserved words, or keywords of the language, and cannot be used as ordinary identifiers.
